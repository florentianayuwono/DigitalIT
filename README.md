## Proposed Level of Achievement
Apollo

## Motivation
Digitalizing one's business is often regarded as the most fundamental thing we should do in today's world. From setting up a seller account in Instagram, Facebook, Shoppee, hiring influencers to review and promote our products and services, using online finance and banking tools in keeping track of our business performance - the list is never ending!

Yet the abundant digital resources that are scattering in the App Store seem to have left those with the least knowledge and experience in the online market with confusion. Particularly in Indonesia, where you could find almost every app for any needs. There are so many choices, and ultimately, we are left with decision questions: Where should I set up my seller profile? Tokopedia? Shoppee? Instagram? Facebook? or _maybe_, Tinder?! Should I just choose everything? But how do I manage all those accounts??

We are determined to help answers those questions. Just as the PwC, McKinsey and BCG to giant corporations in the world, we aim to be a personal consultant to these small business owners. We are trying to integrate the consulting services into our end product, perhaps testing on how machine learning could help in decision making process. Once we are able to do so, this web application could potentially automate the business consulting practice.

## Vision
DigitalIT will be a web application focusing on making decisions and generating recommendations on growth strategy based on the user's business profile and condition. We are starting from basic feature such as determining suitable e-commerce platform based on the business categories (fashion, electronics or culinary). But ultimately, we are aiming for DigitalIT to be able to generate much more advanced recommendations - similar to those generated by professional business consultants.
